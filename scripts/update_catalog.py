    prompt = f"""
    You are a Quantitative Financial Analyst and Technical Documenter for an institutional trading pipeline.
    Your task is to compare the variables defined in the codebase with the existing markdown table in var_catalog.md.
    
    Identify any variable missing from the markdown table by cross-referencing:
    1. Financial tickers and indicators in the lists of config.py.
    2. Engineered interaction ratios in data_pipeline.py (look for the string names passed to the `safe_ratio` function, e.g., 'ratio_copper_gold').

    Generate ONLY the missing table rows in this exact markdown format:
    | `ticker_1M_ret`, `ticker_3M_ret`, `ticker_6M_ret` | Full Name | Description | Category | Source |

    STRICT CONTENT RULES FOR COLUMNS:
    - **Full Name:** You MUST provide the actual, professional name of the asset or ratio (e.g., "Toyota Motor Corp.", "Copper / Gold Ratio", "10-Year Minus 2-Year Treasury Yield Spread"). Do NOT just repeat the ticker. Use your financial knowledge and the inline code comments to figure this out.
    - **Description:** Provide a highly specific, institutional-grade macroeconomic explanation. What does this measure? Why is it relevant for forecasting a broad market index? (e.g., "The Growth/Inflation Engine. Measures industrial expansion against safe-haven hoarding." or "Systemic Japanese proxy for global automotive manufacturing."). ABSOLUTELY DO NOT write lazy generic text like "1-month percentage returns for X".
    - **Category:** Group them logically based on the list names in config.py (e.g., "MACRO INDICATORS", "SYSTEMIC US EQUITIES", "FRED MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS"). For ratios in data_pipeline.py, use "ENGINEERED INTERACTIONS".
    - **Source:** State "Yahoo Finance", "FRED", or "Pipeline Transformation" (for engineered ratios).

    STRICT FORMATTING RULES:
    - For config.py tickers: The code abbreviation must be lowercase and stripped of special characters (e.g., ^TNX becomes tnx, CL=F becomes cl).
    - For data_pipeline.py ratios: Use the exact string name from the safe_ratio call (e.g., ratio_copper_gold) and append _1M_ret, _3M_ret, _6M_ret.
    - Do not output table headers. Do not output markdown codeblock backticks (```).
    - If there are no missing variables, output the exact string "NO_MISSING_VARIABLES".
