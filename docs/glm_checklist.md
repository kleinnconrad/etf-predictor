### 1. Data Preparation
* **Imputation [✅ Pass]:** Missing values were appropriately replaced. *Implementation: Forward-fill (`.ffill()`) applied to lower-frequency FRED data upon merging to strictly prevent look-ahead bias.*
* **Outlier Handling [✅ Pass]:** Extreme data points were identified and adequately handled. *Implementation: Deterministic Winsorization (clipping at 1st and 99th percentiles) derived exclusively from training data.*
* **Skewness [⚠️ Partial Pass / Deliberate Choice]:** Highly skewed distributions were analyzed and transformed. *Implementation: Explicit log transformations are omitted because transforming absolute prices into rolling percentage momentum naturally centers the distribution, and clipping handles the extremes.*
* **Scaling & Normalization [✅ Pass]:** Numerical variables were scaled to ensure a uniform magnitude. *Implementation: `StandardScaler` (Z-transformation) applied safely post-split to normalize volatility across distinct asset classes.*
* **Categorization (Binning) [✅ Pass]:** Continuous variables were grouped into meaningful ordinal classes. *Implementation: Continuous future returns are dynamically binned into discrete `Up`, `Flat`, and `Down` target classes based on inflation and margin parameters.*

### 2. Feature Engineering & Selection
* **Pattern Features [✅ Pass]:** Complex behavioral patterns were extracted. *Implementation: Static absolute prices are transformed into rolling temporal patterns (1M, 3M, 6M percentage returns).*
* **Interaction Effects [✅ Pass]:** Relevant interactions were identified and included. *Implementation: Deterministic macroeconomic spreads/ratios (e.g., Copper/Gold, HYG/LQD) are explicitly engineered.*
* **Multicollinearity [✅ Pass]:** High correlations between independent variables were checked and removed. *Implementation: Handled mechanically via the strict 5-fold cross-validated Sequential Feature Selection.*
* **Variable Selection (Stepwise Selection) [✅ Pass]:** Significant predictors were systematically selected. *Implementation: A two-stage wrapper approach using `SelectKBest` (ANOVA F-test) as a pre-filter, followed by `SequentialFeatureSelector` (forward selection).*

### 3. Model Setup
* **Link Function & Distribution Family [✅ Pass]:** The response variable was correctly assessed and the appropriate link function applied. *Implementation: `LogisticRegression` mechanically applies the Multinomial distribution family and Softmax link function for the 3-class target.*

### 4. Training & Validation (Validation Strategy)
* **Out-of-Time Validation [✅ Pass]:** The data split was performed with a strict temporal shift to prevent data leakage. *Implementation: `TimeSeriesSplit` utilizing the `gap=horizon` parameter guarantees training windows never overlap with evaluation windows.*
* **Overfitting / Underfitting Check [✅ Pass]:** Model performance was compared across datasets. *Implementation: Automated generation and comparison of In-Sample (Training) versus Out-of-Sample (Cross-Validation) advanced confusion matrices.*

### 5. Model Evaluation & Business Metrics
* **Optimal Cutoff Point [✅ Pass]:** The classification threshold was optimized in a data-driven manner. *Implementation: Dynamic threshold optimization using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic specifically calibrates the trigger point for the `Down` class.*
* **Alpha & Beta Error Analysis [✅ Pass]:** The tolerance for False Positives and False Negatives was weighed. *Implementation: Dynamic logarithmic class weighting mathematically penalizes the model for missing minority classes, combating base-rate bias.*
* **Uplift Modeling [✅ Pass]:** The incremental value of the model compared to a baseline strategy was quantified. *Implementation: A mandatory "Quality Gate" requires Out-of-Fold (OOF) accuracy to definitively exceed a baseline threshold before forecasting artifacts are generated.*
